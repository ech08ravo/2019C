## Team Pull Request Model

This model outlines the interactions between team members when generating or approving pull requests. Pull requests can be generated by any team member but can only be approved once they have been reviewed and received comments by at least two other members of the team (3 in total with the original pull requester). 

When a pull request is generated, team members will assign it to all team members who will then discuss with each other to approve or amend. Once approved, the original requester can conduct the merge, they do not have to wait until Sunday or specific meetings if the minimum review criteria is reached. Of note, the exception to this process is small changes which do not effect the overall project such as spelling errors or updates to weekly meeting agendas.
