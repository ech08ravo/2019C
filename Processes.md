## Team Pull Request Model

This model outlines the interactions between team member when generating or approving pull requests. Pull requests can be generated by any team member but can only be approved once they have been reviewed and recieved comments by at least four other members of the team. When a pull request is generated, team memebers will assign it to all team members who will then discuss with each other to approve or amend. Once approved, the original poster can conduct the merge, they do not have to wait until Sundays or specific meetings if the minium review criteria is reached. Of note, the exception to this process is small changes which do not effect the overall project such as spelling errors or updates to weekly meeting adgendas.
