I would like to investigate other Instructional Design Models that would be more effective than the ADDIE model I am familiar with using. 

I would like to go into game based learning design. Motor learning games at work would be an effective teaching tool for me to explore. 


## Design patterns

> What do you see as interesting solutions to recurrent problems of (design) community sites? Use [this template](https://github.sydney.edu.au/crli/EDPC5022-2019/blob/master/resources/design-pattern-template.md) to describe the pattern. You can think of this in two ways: (a) the site contains interesting patterns/models that learning designers should be aware of, and/or (b) the *site itself* can be the basis for patterns a models, in particular in it's community aspects.

## Models

### Model 1: Main Components

> In this section, use the [UML component notation](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/uml/uml_component_diagram.htm) to visualise the main components of the site and the relations between these components. Describe the model in words as well. A short video on component diagrams is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipKJwnPsst8). 

**Example:**

### Model 2: Dynamic aspects

Using [Use Case Diagram](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/uml/uml_use_case_diagram.htm) notation and/or [Activity Diagram](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/uml/uml_activity_diagram.htm) notation, describe a or the key dynamic aspect of the system. Video tutorials are for instance this one on [Activity diagrams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFTAIj2N2Lc&t=158s) and this one on [Use case diagrams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zid-MVo7M-E). 

Tiny example: 

```
@startuml

title Activity Diagram \n

start

:Eat Hot Wings;

note left
    This is a Note...
    * Activity diagrams can begin with a Start
    * An activity is colon, some words, and a semicolon
    * Activity diagrams can end with a stop
end note

:Drink Homebrew;

stop

For your one model, put the (likely longer) code into an appendix.
