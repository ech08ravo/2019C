# Insights and lessons learned

Use this document to capture and reflect on insights into design process, collaboration and communication, method and tool use. Maintained mainly by the *Knowledge Manager*, but should have comments and contributions from other roles as well. 


11/04 - Confusion among the team between the difference of the different models - Use Case, Interaction and Component.  Seems like a lot of overlap and not sure when to use which model.  The team is happy to try it out and hope for feedback and direction if we're on the right track.

2/5 - Between the period of week 8 class and week 9 class with the extra week included for the mid-semester break, the following actions caused further confusion for the team and the work the team was doing:
1. The original team process was to do delegated work, then review it together and merge requests together in our weekly meeting after class.
2. Peter started reviewing what each team was doing in class which meant that merges needed to occur before class and not after class so that they would show in his review of the team's work.
3. In week 8 class, Peter mentioned that the person who makes changes to a document can merge it instead of the knowledge manager or facilitator.  This was contradictory to the group's process model where we had the knowledge manager or facilitator being the ones to merge.
4. In the group meeting in week 8, one of the activity outcomes was to create a truely "futuristic" Use Case model whereby AI essentially does everything without human input.  This model was created and a branch and pull request submitted.  However, the next day EB posted details and comments from Peter stating the AI cannot be a User in a Use Case model.  Although Peter was tagged in the pull request to clarify if the model was still valid, the pull request was then merged and the comment deleted, and it took several days to discover this and then re-contact Peter for clarification.  Peter then confirmed this so, this model was then scrapped and an agreement to revert to the two original models that we had instead of a truely "futuristic" one.
5. In the meantime, new models were created and merged and the original model was lost creating more confusion among the team - where did the new models stem from? Where did the old model go?  This was a break from the normal process.
6. In week 9 class, Peter further clarified the Use Case models versus scenario modeling (which we had been doing).  This provided clarity to the team but would have been better if this clarity had been provided several weeks earlier before we started attempting Use Case modeling as it may have helped avoid the situation above.
7. In week 9 group meeting, the process of pull requests and merging was agreed upon again with agreement that we needed to have a discussion and critiques in the pull request and only a majority of members in agreement will then merge (for modeling).

**Lessons learned** from this experience:
* Need to wait on merging pull requests from models
* Need more communication on where / how / why models are being developed
* Comments in Pull requests get deleted once merged (which means we may need to reconsider our critiquing process as we are currently commenting and critiquing in pull requests)
* The difference between scenario and use case modeling

7/5 - Two learnings from this week's activities that were discussed:  
* a need to check the internal logic across all the models to ensure they are aligned and 
* a need to define terms that were being used in the models - "Personalisation Engine", "xAPI", and "Learning Environment" to ensure that all team members are on the same page.
These needs arose during the week as various team members were creating models where the logic did not necessarily align with the "parent" scenario model.  While having this discussion, it became clear that one of the problems was different interpretations of the various terms in the parent model.  So, the discussion revolved around making an agreed definition of the terms to then enter into ReadMe and then to go through the parent model and ensure that everyone's understanding of the parent model, flow and logic is the same so that everyone is on the same page.  Now members will check the underpinning logic of the models to make sure they align with the parent model and that all models will now flow and make sense as part of the whole.
An additional learning from this week was that the decision from last week to have a majority agree before doing a merge was not feasible as not enough people where discussing / approving.  So, another decision was made this week that only two other people can approve to merge a pull request.  This will hopefully result in faster decision making.
