<Welcome to the EDPC5022 Group C repo!>
=========================================
Our group project seeks to envision and design the future learning design environments. 

We are figuring out what kind of learning environments will designers have to create in five years more. And which methods and technologies are they going to need in support of their work.

To address these questions, we are working on different design prototypes that you can explore in our repo. 

This README.md provides you with the key information of the project and also gives you an orientation about how to navigate through the repo. 


## System design overview

We aim to generate a metadesign for a future learning environment in 5 years time. We address the needs of our stakeholders, (a) sponsor manager and (b) team of developers. Provided here an overview of goals, requirements, high-level design decisions to faciitate the implementation of this design platform.

### Use cases

We propose two levels of future learning designs, one at an 'achievable' level and one at 'ideal'.

### Components

Consisted within the design framework are the compoents outlined below.
