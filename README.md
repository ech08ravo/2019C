Welcome to the EDPC5022 Group C repo!
=========================================
Our group project seeks to envision and design the future learning design environments. 

We are figuring out what kind of learning environments will designers have to create in five years more. And which methods and technologies are they going to need in support of their work.

To address these questions, we are working on different design prototypes that you can explore in our repo. 

This README.md provides you with the weekly updates of the project and also gives you an orientation about how to navigate through the repo.


## System design overview

This week we are working on two issues ([#32](https://github.sydney.edu.au/crli/EDPC5022-2019-TeamC/issues/32) and [#33](https://github.sydney.edu.au/crli/EDPC5022-2019-TeamC/issues/33))related to developing ideas for integrating Design Critique into a scalable, distributed Learning Design and Authoring process. 

You can check our designs in the following sections.

### Use cases

Here is showed the use cases that we have modelled to capture the systemâ€™s high-level requirements.

### Interaction sequences

Here is depicted the structure of the system.
