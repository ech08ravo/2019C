### Use Case Model
**Duration (15 minutes):**
- Use Case 2 was decided as an Interaction model.
- Quang explained Use Case 1 - AI system, personalisation and adaotive engines, including analytics to self-generate
- Dominique explained Use Case 2 - decided that it was an Interactions model. Needs to specify Users in more specific terms. Dominique will adapt to Use case 1 for an Interactions model.
- Daniela designed Use Case 3 - Designer uses learning constraints input plus use learning analytics - the designer takes input and selects pedagogical pattern to create
- Question of whether the Use case models go far enough in terms of future-forward thinking - 5-10 years? Perhaps a bit limited to achievable in the present.
- Group decided to stick to 2 models - ideal and achievable. Team members to keep thinking about possible future scenarios but stick with 2 models. 

********

## Follow up actions (Facilitator, Knowledge Manager, Team Members)
1. Quang to write Contributing.MD for the group: team members can then add any major changes to the md.
2. Dominique to model the Interactions.md
3. Madeline will edit Use Case 1 model where people will be replaced entirely by AI (replacing course and system designer)
4. Agustina will change Readme.md
5. Quang will change Processes and Contributing.md: Quang has to change workflow diagram and add Madeline's idea of working with branches and name them with the corresponding week #. All of us will work in our branches with the component and interactions diagrams.
6. Madeline to open an Issue for chatting

# Additional notes taken during the meeting (Knowledge Manager, Facilitator)
- How many Use Cases need to be generated? 
- Does it go far enough in addressing the future-learning environment of 5-10 years? 
- Keep to 2 models and continue with it for the duration of the project. Other teams working on one model and another is a components diagram that is more in-depth.
- Modify Use Case 1 as the ideal case by eliminating human designers. Replace course designer with AI. The teacher achieve the whole process without the Designer through AI.
- Prefered ways of discussing items: continue using Issues. Work in our own branch then commit - each week we can create a branch for the week, then review all the pull requests at the meeting. Before committing, edit the name of the branch to week#.
- Quang will add to Process and Contributing.
- Pull requests - still assigning to Knowledge manager and Facilitator? Limiting. 
- Stick with the same process.
- Remember to close Issues as they are complete.
- Completing all tasks before Easter is not likely due to work and commitments. Madeline will open an Issue for chatting to see whether a meeting next week is required.
