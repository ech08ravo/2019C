## Follow up actions (Facilitator, Knowledge Manager)
Dominique will send text of the use case model to Quang and he will model it in PlantText.  Dominique will put it int he UseCase.md file and use a pull request and assign Quang who will edit it with the model and merge it.  All other team members will then review and discuss at next meeting.


# Additional notes taken during the meeting (Knowledge Manager, Facilitator)


- MB to put in the link for how to put in a folder the EB sent into the meeting minutes
- Review and Feedback of Github pages
        * MB:  Meeting - created a folder and putting the pages into the sub-folder.  Roster - Completed and added today.  Insights - to be filled in by Facilitator and Knowledge Manager each week.
        * Agustina -  Looked into Component Diagrams - the elements of a system
        * Kira - Use Cases - functionalities of the system - inputs / outputs and the actors
        * Dominique -  Readme file - Document of short summaries communicating to stakeholders with links to the models in the other files.
        * Quang - Interactions are the UML diagrams linking to the Readme and the Processes file is our file on our team work internal processes.  Quang will insert the model he did into the Processes page.

*Always to a Pull Request and the always assign the Knowledge Manager and Facilitator to approve it and pull it.  

- Site Analysis Task - what happened to it?  Is this part of the assignment?  Are we supposed to be using these in the project?  Ask Peter to clarify.


Brainstorming on this week's task:
-  How can AI get info it wants from the internet.  Can the designer help direct this or input info that they want and then the AI goes to retreive it and then the designer approves it.
- the AI system needs a repsitory storage that has all possibilities.  Then have a search engine kind of thing where you can put in your requirements and then it looks through all the info in the storage that fit within your requirements.
- Insert the course objective and duration and then it shoots out the materials
-  Maybe in futuristic idea - the AI could find the material and then tell you what the duration, etc. would be and suggestions for assessments and activities.  But this then removes the creativity element.
- Need to merge it to be able to have the designer input creativity.  
- Maybe put in some elements into it and then the AI makes the rest of the recommendations
- The AI would learn how the designer works and the design patterns they use and then the AI would be able to do this.
- Need a model that has a balance between the automation and creativity
- The interaction model will be to have the interactions with the AI and the Designer and the student?
- Use case models how the actors flow through the model
- Components - create a model with the different components - the AI, the Designer, the Storage, et.
-Add a learning analytics component int eh model that connects the first part of the content design with the data that gives feedback to the design patterns.
