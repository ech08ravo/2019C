**In attendance:** Madeline, Dominique, Quang, Kira, Daniela, Agustina.

**Facilitator:** Kira

**Knowledge Manager:** Agustina

## A. Agenda: Topics/Goals (Facilitator)

1. Feedback on updated processes
2. Update on tasks (how did we find it, anything left to clarify/ammend)
3. Outstanding Pull Requests needing approval
4. Design Critique update
5. Tasks for week 10
6. Other business

## B. Activities/Decisions (Knowledge Manager)

1. Clarified the meaning of PE / xAPI / LA

1.1. PE -> Characteristics
- Two-fold function: search engine + AI. 
- Looks info in the web and repository AND ALSO comes up with a suggestion based on that search to include in the LE. 
- It has AI.

1.2. xAPI -> Characteristics
- Only monitors interactions in the LE and stores them into the LA. 
- It doesn’t have AI.

1.3. LA -> Characteristics
- Learning Analytics Platform feeds to the PE which feeds to the LE.

2. Course designer will only engage with the PE not the LA. 
3. Only 2 voters + the creator of the PR (3 in total) for merging pull requests instead of 5. 
4. Finished tweaking the parent use case model so that it better flows with the logic of the interaction diagrams. 
5. When we change our individual models we will commit directly if changes are small and articulated with parent use case/interaction diagrams. Only huge changes will be put in Pull Requests.

## Follow up actions (Facilitator, Knowledge Manager)

1. Develop glossary for each of the components (what each of them does in the system as a whole) and put that on Readme repo - KIRA.
2. Check those definitions and then check our individual models to see if they meet the parent model’s overall logic – ALL.
3. Change the original use case parent model and add the Design Critique (DC) bit to it BUT in a smaller use case that will only contemplate PE/Cloud Depository/LE + DC. Explain in the narrative that the LA and xAPI exist but are not being modelled – QUANG.
4. Change the interactions diagram and add democratisation where learners also contribute resources to the Cloud Depository and are part of the Design Critique team – MADIE.
5. Update Insights – MADIE.
6. Update Contributing (2 people instead of 4) – DOMINIQUE.
