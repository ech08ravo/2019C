# Notes from the meeting recording (Knowledge Manager)

Glossary: Glossary to be moved from README.md to it's own repo, with a link placed within the README ACTION: Kira

Group consensus reached on use of REpository rather than DEpository. Needs to be updated across all models and pages. ACTION: All

Changes to Adaptive LD Model: LAP and Instructor interactions. Democratic contributions! Instructor, Course Designer and Learner can add to cloud. Personalisation Engine to Learning Environment link. Note: All can update Adaptive LD Model not just Quang. Ensure this is done through Pull Requests.

Role of System Administrator: Tech support, Interacts with Course environment, Add to Cloud


Insights: a lot of feedback is from people going into detail of models. Narrative is being built weekly. Cyclical process. Needs to be monitored and updated as required. ACTION: Madeline and Daniela.


Narratives: Dominique goes through the narratives, focus on interaciton diagrams and write how she wants to link the diagrams, and all can copy that formatting and follow that system. Put a pull request. By tomorrow morning. Kira to follow up and confirm logic (sanity check). ACTION: Dominique, Kira, All
