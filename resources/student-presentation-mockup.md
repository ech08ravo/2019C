# Presentation plan

**Student:**

**Topic:** 

**********

//Use this document to help plan your presentation. Just like in the workplace, you'll have a colleague review it before you present in class, and give you feedback about specific aspects of your plan structure and content. They'll be using a checklist of quality indicators, which are essentially the same as the grading criteria for this task. When you receive feedback and address it in this document, you should ensure you use the comment field to explain the changes you made in response, and why.//

//Your presentation should be focused on one unit reading. It should identify the main conceptual ideas from the text, and the implications for design in your professional (or other situated) context. It should be suitable for a brief 20 minute presentation (including online participants) plus 10 minutes of Q&A. Both your presentation & paper are intended both as a domain knowledge task for you, and a useful resource for the others in your class. You will present to the class and your paper will be made available online. Please export your Markdown or other document to PDF as Adobe Connect and PowerPoint do *not* work well as a team.//

//The **ideal** presentation  
+ Demonstrates a thorough understanding of context, audience, and purpose that is responsive to the assigned task(s) and focuses all elements of the work.
+ Uses appropriate, relevant, and compelling content to illustrate mastery of the subject, conveying the writer's understanding, and shaping the whole work.
+ Demonstrates detailed attention to and successful execution of a wide range of conventions particular to a specific discipline and/or writing task (s) including organisation, content, presentation, formatting, and stylistic choices.
+ Demonstrates skillful use of high-quality, credible, relevant sources to develop ideas that are appropriate for the discipline and genre of the writing.
+ Uses graceful language that skillfully communicates meaning to readers with clarity and fluency, and is virtually error-free.//


// You can use this document as a simple template. You don't have to follow the format below, but you will want to consider these points when preparing your in-class presentation for peer review.//

//You can also use markdown editors such as [https://yhatt.github.io/marp/] or [https://dillinger.io/] but *be aware they may not save a local version of your file*. Make sure you move your markdown to a file in your GitHub repo and save (Commit) **frequently**.//
