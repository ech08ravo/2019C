2. In the *Conversation* tab, you will see your colleague's comment, with a link below to their document. You can also click the **Files changed** tab to view the document.
3. Review the document.
4. There are several ways to provide feedback. All these should be used with extreme care. Make sure you talk to your pair about which method they would like to use to manage your input. Be as specific with your feedback as possible, remembering to be constructive.

   a. Click Add your review on the Pull requests tab. See step 5.

   b. leave your comments in the "write" comment box, then click **Comment**. See step 6.

   c. On the Files changed tab, click the pencil and edit the file directly. See step 7.

5. Adding a review can provide general feedback, or specific feedback with approval, or specific feedback that must be addressed before approval. If you approve, at the Changes approved panel, click Merge pull request. This will overwrite the master document with the one you have just approved.
6. Writing comments provides feedback to the presenter, and does not modify their file. They will review your comments, make changes to their draft, and either ask for further feedback or Commit their file to their master thread.
7. Editing the file updates the file, which can be either directly Committed to the presenter's master branch or to a separate branch in your repo. Your comments will be located in the short and long comment boxes at the bottom of the page near the Commit button.
