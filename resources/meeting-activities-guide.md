template -> [GitHub 3-12-3](https://github.sydney.edu.au/crli/EDPC5022-2019/blob/master/resources/ActivityModels/3-12-3.md)


 *This format for brainstorming compresses the essentials of an ideation session into one short format. The numbers 3-12-3 refer to the amount of time in minutes given to each of three activities: 3 minutes for generating a pool of observations, 12 for combining those observations into rough concepts, and 3 again for presenting the concepts back to a group.*

 In this variant, ideas are entered in a single spreadsheet. Can be used by individuals or teams. The attributes are optional, and ought to be removed if none are desired.

 Alternatively, one should leave them blank initially and come back to them in a second round of brainstorming.

 Note that to gather data, Sheets can have multiple tabs, each having its own URL. So, one can decide to keep all responses in one spreadsheets with multiple sheets, or distribute multiple spreadsheets.

**Divergent	- Brainwriting - Idea generation; mental model alignment**

template -> [GH Brainwriting](https://github.sydney.edu.au/crli/EDPC5022-2019/blob/master/resources/ActivityModels/brainwriting.md)

*Some of the best ideas are compilations from multiple contributors. Brainwriting is a simple way to generate ideas, share them, and subsequently build on them within a group. Access to multiple hands, eyes, and minds can yield the most interesting results.*

While the index-card format may not work with a distributed team, using Google Sheets allows players to cycle through other participants’ idea lists and enter their contributions in the same row.

**Divergent	- Five Whys - Idea generation; mental model alignment**

source -> [gamestorming.com](http://gamestorming.com/the-5-whys/)

template -> [GH Five Whys](https://github.sydney.edu.au/crli/EDPC5022-2019/blob/master/resources/ActivityModels/5-whys.md)

*Many of the games in this book are about seeing the bigger picture or relating a problem to its context. The 5 Whys game mirrors that motive to move beyond the surface of a problem and discover the root cause, because problems are tackled more sustainably when they’re addressed at the source.*

This format needs participants to be frank about their existing conceptions about the root causes of the problem under consideration. Encourage team members to include information about why they hold that belief. You may need to discuss the underlying beliefs to get to a meaningful ‘why’.

**Divergent / Convergent/ Evaluation	- Repertory Grid Technique (RGT) - Idea generation, mental model alignment; creating agreement & consensus; decision-making; evaluation**

source -> [Curtis, A. M., Wells, T. M., Higbee, T., & Lowry, P. B. (2008). An overview and tutorial of the repertory grid technique in information systems research.](https://usyd.summon.serialssolutions.com/#!/search?bookMark=ePnHCXMwXV09D8IgEG1MBzX-iIvOTSilUEZj_NhcOriZAtekSzW16t_3UIjGjYQLCZA73jt4xzxJibfixJcp5dqLc8ldvu1pzPCLUvNZclr3cHx4r8AnEHWG2iv3aeXh0gIhICAYioO_bob90FF3LGwKXQ9BsOMnAKG-N8T3aoskHYc7Rdh6t603hyz8LJBdCUFnkiviRQ0q66yVKAtbIDJlmTB0mqKQjBPhdI1BURiXM)

Repertory Grid Technique (RGT, also RepGrid) is a process used to find out what people think about a person, situation or object. It allows the element/s of inquiry to be evaluated by asking participants how they differentiate between two or more examples. It also allows ranking by the importance of each construct.

You can use an online system like http://grid.eilab.ca/ or a simple spreadsheet. RepGrid can be helpful to align the group’s mental models around meaning-making, and to set and measure priorities and progress. For example, after you know what all your group members think about the most important aspects of assessment task, use RepGrid at intervals to see how your task progress is tracking in relation to those areas/constructs.

**Divergent / Convergent - Mind/concept mapping - Idea generation; mental model alignment; sorting/ clustering**

source -> [Florida Institute for Human & Machine Cognition (IHMC)](http://cmap.ihmc.us/docs/concept-map.php?url=http://cmapskm.ihmc.us/viewer/cmap/1L2W8S4VP-1T8MH1F-273G&title=Concept%20Map%20about%20Concept%20Maps)

template -> [MindMeister](https://www.mindmeister.com/)

*Mind/Concept maps are often used to collect and connect related ideas.*

You can either use a tool that allows collaborative drawing, or nominate a team member to construct the map from other participants’ contributions.

**Convergent - Affinity mapping - Sorting/ clustering; creating agreement & consensus**

source -> [gamestorming.com](http://gamestorming.com/affinity-map/)

template -> [GH Affinity Map](https://github.sydney.edu.au/crli/EDPC5022-2019/blob/master/resources/ActivityModels/affinity-map.md)

*Most of us are familiar with brainstorming—a method by which a group generates as many ideas around a topic as possible in a limited amount of time. Brainstorming works to get a high quantity of information on the table. But it begs the follow-up question of how to gather meaning from all the data.*

 Using a simple Affinity Diagram technique can help us discover embedded patterns (and sometimes break old patterns) of thinking by sorting and clustering language-based information into relationships. It can also give us a sense of where most people’s thinking is focused. Use an affinity diagram when you want to find categories and meta-categories within a cluster of ideas and when you want to see which ideas are most common within the group.

Affinity mapping can be particularly helpful when regional or cultural differences may influence the language we use to describe system elements. It can be challenging to perform in an online environment with many participants, so you may want to consider conducting the initial activity online with a follow-up offline between meetings. Online tools range from very simple, such as (http://www.padlet.com) through to system modelling platforms such as (http://www.kumu.io).

**Convergent - Card sorting - Sorting/ clustering; creating agreement & consensus**

source -> [gamestorming.com](http://gamestorming.com/card-sort/)

template -> [GH Card Sorting](https://github.sydney.edu.au/crli/EDPC5022-2019/blob/master/resources/ActivityModels/card-sort.md)

*Card sorting is a practice used frequently by information architects and designers to gather and structure inputs for a variety of purposes.*

In a common use of card sorting, information for a website is put onto the cards, and the sorting helps create categories for navigation and the overall architecture. The method works just as well for creating slides for presentations, or at any point where information needs to be sorted and organised in a sensible way.

Card sorting can be done using whatever materials are at hand. Some options for face-to-face meetings are post-it-notes or sheets of paper, and online options can include tools such as (http://www.trello.com) or [github project boards](https://github.com/features/project-management/), for which the University has an institutional licence.

**Evaluation - Dot voting - Decision-making; generating commitment; evaluation**

source -> [gamestorming.com](http://gamestorming.com/dot-voting/)

template -> [GH Dot voting](https://github.sydney.edu.au/crli/EDPC5022-2019/blob/master/resources/ActivityModels/dot-voting.md)

*First, the group needs a set of things to vote on! This may be something they have just developed, such as a wall of sticky notes, or it may be a flip-chart list that captures the ideas in one place.*
Ask the group to cast their votes by placing a dot next to the items they feel the most strongly about. They may use stickers or markers to do this. As a rule of thumb, giving each participant five votes to cast works well.

This format will be sensitive to the number of group members as well as the number of ideas in play.

For online or blended groups, consider using the Polling feature of your preferred meeting platform.

**Evaluation - Forced ranking - Decision-making; creating agreement & consensus; generating commitment; evaluation**

source -> [gamestorming.com](http://gamestorming.com/350/)

template -> [GH Forced ranking](https://github.sydney.edu.au/crli/EDPC5022-2019/blob/master/resources/ActivityModels/forced-ranking.md)

*When prioritising, a group may need to agree on a single, ranked list of items. Forced ranking obligates the group to make difficult decisions, and each item is ranked relative to the others.*

This is an important step in making decisions on items like investments, business priorities, and features or requirements—wherever a clear, prioritised list is needed.

Clear criteria are important for this format, and it is preferable to deal with multiple criteria separately, for example, level of cost and level of complexity. It may be that there are several ideas that attain similar scores, in which case the criteria can themselves be ranked in terms of importance.
