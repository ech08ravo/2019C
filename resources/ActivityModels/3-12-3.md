**Object of Play**
This format for brainstorming compresses the essentials
of an ideation session into one short format.
The numbers 3-12-3 refer to the amount of
time in minutes given to each of three activities:
3 minutes for generating a pool of observations,
12 for combining those observations into rough concepts,
and 3 again for presenting the concepts back to a group.

Essential to this format is strict time keeping.
The “ticking clock” forces spontaneous, quick-fire
decisions and doesn’t allow for overthinking.
With this in mind, a group that is typically heavily
measured in its thought process will benefit
the most from this exercise but will also be
the hardest to engage. Given its short duration
(30 minutes total for 10 participants),
3-12-3 Brainstorming can be used as an
energiser before diving into a longer
exercise or as a standalone, zero-prep activity.
It works equally well in generating new ideas
as improvements to existing ones.;

note right
//Speed is key //
Many traditional brainstorming techniques
can be slowed down or fouled entirely
when time is not of the essence,
despite the best intentions of participants.
Additionally, speed helps prove the value
of what can be accomplished in short
bursts—often the important aspects of
good ideas can be captured very quickly
and do not require laborious discussion
before first coming to light.

/' activity sequence '/
:**Activity 1 - 3 minutes**
//Generate a Pool of Aspects//
For the first three minutes of the exercise,
participants are asked to think about the
characteristics of the topic at hand and
to write down as many of them as they can
on separate index cards (or in your
online environment).

It may accelerate the group’s process
to think in terms of “nouns and verbs”
that come to mind when thinking about
the subject, or to free-associate.
As in all brainstorming, no filtering should be
put on this phase, in which the goal is a
large pool of aspects in a small window
of three minutes.
;

:**Activity 2 - 12 Minutes**
//Develop Concepts//
At this point the group
is divided into pairs. Each team draws
three cards randomly from the pool.
With these as thought starters, the teams
now have 12 minutes to develop a concept
to present back to the larger group.

If the two topic words are sufficient
to explain the challenge, the clock starts
and the teams begin. If there is any doubt,
reveal a more fleshed-out version of
the topic’s focus, such as “How will
we become more energy-efficient next
quarter?” In developing concepts to present,
teams may create rough sketches, prototypes,
or other media—the key is in preparing
for a short (three-minute maximum)
presentation of their concept back to the group.;

:**Activity 3 - 3 minutes**
//Make Presentations//
When presenting to the larger group, teams may
reveal the cards that they drew and how the
cards influenced their thinking.

Again, tight time keeping is critical here —
every team should have a maximum of three
minutes to present their concept.
After every team has presented, the
entire group may reflect on what was uncovered.
;

: **Now what?**
After presenting concepts back to the group,
teams may do a number of things. They may dig
deeper on an individual concept or try to
integrate the ideas into each other.

They may vote or rank the concepts
to decide on which to spend more time
developing. Often, concepts coming out
of this exercise are more memorable
to the participants, who are bonded
in the time-driven stress of creating together.;
