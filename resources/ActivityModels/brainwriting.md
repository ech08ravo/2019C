:The source of this activity is [[https://gamestorming.com/brainwriting/{link to source of activity design} gamestorming.com]]
and it will take around 30-45 minutes.

**Object of Play**
Some of the best ideas are compilations from multiple contributors.
Brainwriting is a simple way to
generate ideas, share them, and
subsequently build on them within
a group. Access to multiple hands,
eyes, and minds can yield
the most interesting results.;

note right
//Strategy //

In a typical group setting, extroverts
tend to dominate the verbal contributions.
And while their contributions are
certainly important, it can be difficult
to hear from quieter players who
also have something valuable to offer.

Let the players know that this play
is intentionally silent.
It affords the quiet people the
opportunity to generate ideas
without having to verbalise to
the whole group, and it gives
you certainty that you’ll hear
from every player in the room.

Brainwriting also allows ideas
to emerge before being critiqued
and creates a space for them to be
co-created, with multiple owners,
and therefore a greater chance of
follow-through.

/' activity sequence '/
://Silent Thinking//
In a space visible to the players,
write the topic around which
you need to generate ideas and
draw a picture of it.

An example of a topic might be
“Sharing Design Patterns.”

Distribute index cards to each player
and ask them to silently generate
ideas related to the topic
and write them on the cards.;

://Sharing Ideas//
As they complete each idea,
ask the players to pass that idea
to the person on their right.;

://Knowledge Advancement//
Tell the players to read the card
they received and think of it as
an “idea stimulation” card.
Ask them to add an idea inspired
by what they just read or to
enhance the idea and then
pass again to their right.

Continue this process of
“brainwriting” and passing cards
to the right until there are
various ideas on each card.;

: **Now what?**
Once finished, collect the cards
and distribute them on the digital or
physical space around the topic and
its picture.

Have the group review the ideas and
annotate those they find most compelling.
Discuss.;

note right
//Optional activity//

Create an idea gallery using a shared
digital space like a whiteboard or [[http://padlet.com/{padlet} padlet.com]].
Ask players to contribute as
many ideas on the sheet as they can
and then add ideas to the others' by
annotating them.
end note

:**Follow this up**
with a card sorting or other activity
to create agreement and consensus.;
