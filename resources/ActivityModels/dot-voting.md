and it will take around 10-15 minutes, depending on the number of participants.

**Object of Play**
In any good brainstorming session, there will come a time when there are too many good ideas, too many concepts, and too many possibilities to proceed. When this time has come, dot voting is one of the simplest ways to prioritise and converge upon an agreed solution.;

note right
//Strategy //

This is a good activity to follow a longer session of sorting or mapping, because it gives you a clear way to move forward from that.

Giving participants five votes is enough to be meaningful while still asking for individual prioritisation; however, this is not a hard rule.

/' activity sequence '/
://Distribute Dots//
Work out how you will indicate votes on the various options, which should be visible to all participants. This might be using a spreadsheet with each player having a column , or a shared whiteboard or padlet where each person has an agreed colour or symbol to indicate their vote.;

://Vote!//
Participants cast their votes all at once and they may vote more than once for a single item if they feel strongly about it. Once all the votes are cast, tally them, and if necessary make a list of the items by their new rank.;


: **Now what?**
This prioritised list becomes the subject of discussion and decision making.;

note right
//Optional activity//

In some cases, it may be useful to reflect on ideas that didn’t receive votes to verify that they haven’t been left behind without cause.

end note

:**Follow this up**
Now you have decided how to proceed, assign action items that will move you forward to the next stage of development.;
