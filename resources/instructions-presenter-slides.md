# Instructions for presenter

The instructions below cover the complete process of forking a repo, editing a file and getting feedback on that file from your peer. In reality, you will probably not do this all as one connected process. You might want to experiment with the for a while before you go ahead the a pull request.

To do this, follow **step 10** below, and your document will be updated immediately. You can then go back to step 4 to continue editing.

When you're ready for peer review, follow **step 11** instead of step ten to create a new branch and assign another student to review your draft.

# How to create a PDF of a Markdown .md

https://dillinger.io/ is an easy way to do this conversion.

Just go to your file in GitHub, and click the Raw button to see the code. **Select All** and **Copy**.

Go to [[http://dillinger.io]] and replace the text in the left hand (Markdown) pane with your text (easy with **Select All** and **Paste**). Your slides will appear in the right hand (Preview) pane.

From the *Export As* menu, select **PDF**. A pdf will be saved to your default Downloads folder.

Then you can just attach in to an email, and we will load it into Adobe Connect using the Share Document menu in presenter mode (which is only available to participants with presenter rights, which you will have in the class, but it can be helpful for us to do this earlier in case of any hassles).

# Step-by-step

1. Goto [github.sydney.edu.au[plus our site url]] and log in with your unikey credentials

1. Click Fork, then when prompted click your @unikey to make a copy of the repo in your own repository

3. Click the document <template.md> to open it

4. Click the pencil icon to edit the document. You can use the [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet "Markdown cheatsheet on GH") for quick reference, or a [markdown editor like Marp](https://yhatt.github.io/marp/ "Marpdown Prsentation Writer") if you're still getting comfortable with code writing.

5. Follow the instructions at [Renaming and Moving files on GitHub](https://github.blog/2013-03-15-moving-and-renaming-files-on-github/ "Renamingand moving files on GH") if you want to rename or move your file

---

6. Add your name and topic to the template (or make other changes, you will use the same method for each version of your draft)

7. Click **Preview changes**; then move back and forward between the Edit file and Preview changes tabs until you are ready to save your changes

8. Scroll down the page until you see the *Commit changes* panel

9. In the smaller text field, type a brief description of the changes you have just made, any why, eg "Added my name and topic" or "removed typo in antedisestablishmentarianism". You will use this method to describe the rationale for changes each time you edit a document. When you need to add a more detailed comment, use the larger text field below as well.

10. [to practice before peer review] Leave the radio button set at *Commit directly to the master branch* and click **Commit changes**

11. [when ready for peer review] Click the radio button labelled **Create a new branch**..., then name the branch "<yourunikey>-presentation-slides" without quotes

12. Click **Propose file change**, and the *Open a pull request* window will display.  You will see that the system is comparing your changed file to your original master branch file (not the original original you forked it from to begin with). Read [About pull requests](https://help.github.com/enterprise/2.15/user/articles/about-pull-requests/ "About pull requests") if you would like more details about how this works.

13. Below the comments you when you edited the file you will see a "diff" (difference) version of your text showing visually the changes that have been made. This allows you to understand the rationale and textual changes together.

---

14. You'll be asking a peer for feedback about your draft presentation. To do this, click the **gear icon** to the right of *Reviewers*, and select one of your classmates to look at your presentation draft. You can do this one or more times.

15. Click **Create pull request**.
