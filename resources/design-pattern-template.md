# Design Pattern Sections

## Name 

> single word or short phrase that refers to the pattern. This allows for rapid association and retrieval.

## Problem 

> definition of a problem, including its intent or a desired outcome, and symptoms that would indicate that this problem exists.


## Context

> preconditions which must exist in order for that problem to occur; this is often a situation. When forces conflict, the resolutions of those conflicts is often implied by the context.


## Forces

> description of forces or constraints and how they interact. Some of the forces may be contradictory. For example: being thorough often conflicts with time or money constraints.


## Solution

> instructions, possibly including variants. The solution may include pictures, diagrams, prose, or other media.

## Examples

> sample applications and solutions, analogies, visual examples, and known uses can be especially helpful, help user understand the context


## Resulting Context

> result after the pattern has been applied, including postconditions and side effects. It might also include new problems that might result from solving the original problem.


## Rationale

> the thought processes that would go into selecting this pattern, The rationale includes an explanation of why this pattern works, how forces and constraints are resolved to construct a desired outcome.


## Related Patterns

> differences and relationships with other patterns, possibly predecessor, antecedents, or alternatives that solve similar problems
