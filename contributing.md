## General rules

1. We check regularly for new issues and pull requests. 
2. We contribute regularly; smaller but more frequent contributions are more useful than longer but sparse contributions.
2. We acknowledge contributions by others we built on. 
3. For everything but cosmetic changes, we create a branch and announce what we intend to do by a pull request. Another important  way to manage work is [issues](https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.16/user/articles/about-issues). 
4. As default, the person that creates a pull request should also merge and close the pull request. Dependent on how much  changes affect others, we seek discussions with [@mentions](https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.16/user/articles/mentions-on-github-pages)  and [reviews](https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.16/user/articles/about-pull-request-reviews). 

In short: We are social and constructive. 

## Weekly workflow

1. The Master branch is the interface with to the stakeholders; commits to it need to be agreed amongst us. 
2. We will update the Master branch at least once per week, by Tuesday evening after the group meeeting each week at the latest. 
3. Based on decisions about goals and tasks made Tuesday evenings, we work on tasks (issues) by creating branches and pull requests by Wednesday evening. 
4. We use Mondays and Tuesdays to discuss and decide on proposed changes to the Master branch (i.e., pull requests).
