## General rules

1. We check regularly for new issues and pull requests. 
2. We follow a weekly worklfow and contribute with smaller but more frequent contributions.
3. We discuss and brainstorm ideas in Issues in order to reach the Milestones assigned.
4. For everything but cosmetic changes (e.g. headings, typing errors), we create a branch and announce what we intend to do by a pull request to the Facilitator and Knowledge Manager.
5. As default, the person that creates a pull request should also merge and close the pull request. Dependent on how many changes affect others, we seek discussions with [@mentions](https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.16/user/articles/mentions-on-github-pages)  and [reviews](https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.16/user/articles/about-pull-request-reviews). 
6. We meet on Adobe Connect every week in order to discuss future planning and determine roles for team members.

Collaboration structure: a balanaced blend of democratic and constructive.

## Weekly workflow

1. The Master branch is the interface with to the stakeholders; commits to it need to be agreed amongst us. 
2. We will meet every Tuesday afternoon during/after class to determine goals and tasks for the week.
3. Based on decisions about goals and tasks made Tuesday evenings, we work on tasks (issues) by creating branches and pull requests from Wednesday-Sunday.
4. Each team member will @mention the Facilitator and Knowledge Manager for the week to approve their suggested pull request.
4. We use Sundays and Mondays to discuss and decide on proposed changes to the Master branch (i.e. pull requests).
5. We will update the Master branch at least once per week, by Monday evening at the latest.
