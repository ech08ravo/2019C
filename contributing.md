## General rules

1. We check regularly for new issues and pull requests. 
2. We follow a weekly workflow and contribute with smaller but more frequent contributions.
3. We discuss and brainstorm ideas and weekly tasks in Issues in order to reach the Milestones assigned.
4. For everything but cosmetic changes (e.g. headings, typing errors), we create a branch and announce what we intend to do by a pull request to all members of the team
5. We meet on Adobe Connect every Tuesday after class in order to discuss future planning and determine roles for team members. When necessary, we also organise a secondary meeting during the week to discuss or action priority items on the agenda. The Facilitator will initiate this via Issues.
6. We seek to collaborate openly and honestly, building on and valuing each person's contributions, opinions and areas of expertise.

Collaboration Aim: democratic and constructive.

## Weekly workflow

1. The Master branch is the interface which we use to pitch our designs to the stakeholders and will be contributed to by all team members throughout the week; commits to it need to be agreed amongst us. 
2. We will meet every Tuesday afternoon during/after class to determine goals and tasks for the week.
3. Based on decisions about goals and tasks made Tuesday evenings, we work on tasks (issues) by creating branches and pull requests from Wednesday-Sunday.
4. Each team member will @mention all members of the group to discuss and approve their suggested pull request.
5. The Facilitator will initiate an 'Issue' each week based on the weekly Milestone task and create a meeting agenda prior to Tuesday meetings. The Knowledge Manager will oversee the direction of the group pull requests and intervene if necessary.
6. We will update the Master branch throughout the week as the pull requests are discussed and approved. 
7. We use Sundays and Mondays to discuss finalise any remaining pull requests that have not been approved. These will be merged prior to Tuesday class.

### Note on Pull Requests
1. Team members will propose design models or seek critiques and approvals for designs to be committed to the Master branch by creating a pull request named "Studentcode-Week-#"
2. Team members will discuss and critique models/items within the pull request until a concensus is reached to approve pull request.
3. Once concensus is reached by a minimum of 2 group members in the pull request, it can then be merged.
4. As default, the person that creates a pull request also merges and closes the pull request. Dependent on how many changes affect others, we seek discussions with [@mentions](https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.16/user/articles/mentions-on-github-pages) and [reviews](https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.16/user/articles/about-pull-request-reviews).
