## Use Case 1

The proposed next-generation LDE involves:
- Cloud based courses and environments depository managed by the system designer. This is constantly updated and managed with technical support for the course designer and student.
- The course designer can use two functions: 
(a) A predictive/adaptive analytics engine to automate the selection of the learning system, platform used, collaboration and teaching tools, learning content and duration. The AI system will use the userâ€™s context (setting, audience, etc), previous behaviours and previous courses to analyse and select from the database to build the best suited model; or 
(b) A personalisation engine to set one or more boundaries to filter from the courses/environments depository.
- The system will then generate the bespoke learning environment that students will interact with.
- CoachU: Through the tracking and monitoring of student interaction with the LE and progression throughout the course, the adaptive system will build further predictive models of best course pathways, especially for students at risk of completing the course successfully, if they are on track with course expectations, or if they need to study more or require additional instructional and/ or institutional support. The course designer will play a managing role rather than design.
