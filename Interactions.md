# Interaction Diagrams

## AI Adaptive LD System Interactions Diagram 

This is a visual representation of the actors within our automated course generator system and the objects that they interact with. The Learning Environment is generated by the Course Designer via the Personalisation Engine. The Personalisation Engine is where the Course Designer sets boundaries regarding what data is to be pulled from the Course Cloud Depository and the Web Engine. The Learner interacts with the Learning Environment which is monitored by the Instructor and by xAPI. xAPI stores user data and sends this data to the Learning Analytics Platform for processing and then to the Personalisation Engine for viewing by the Course Designer. The Course Designer then activates a process pulling additional resources from the Web engine and the Course Cloud Depository in order to recommend additional resources to the Learner based on any areas needing improvement. A System Designer provides technical support to the Learning Environment.  

The AI Adaptive LD System Interactions Diagram aligns with:
* The AI Adaptive LD System Use Scenario model found [*here*](https://github.sydney.edu.au/crli/EDPC5022-2019-TeamC/blob/master/Use-cases.md)
* The AI Adaptive LD System Component model found [*here*](https://github.sydney.edu.au/crli/EDPC5022-2019-TeamC/blob/master/Components.md)

## Learning Analytics Platform Interactions Diagram 

This diagram shows the interactions that occur within the Learning Analytics Platform.

## Course Generation Sequence Diagram

This sequence diagram model show actors add resources and activities into a Cloud Depository on an ongoing basis. When a course needs to be designed the Course Designer enters in course details such as subjects, pedagogy and course duration into the Personalisation Engine. The Personalisation Engine then searches through both the Cloud Depository and the Web to find suitable resources and activities to meet the criteria as entered by the Course Designer into the Personalisation Engine. The Course Designer then reviews and approves what the engine retreives. Once approved, the course is set up as a prototype. At this point the Community of Practice, Teachers, Students, Designers and Experts have the opportunity to conduct a design critique. Once adjustments / improvements are made to the design, the Course Designer gives a final approval and the Personalisation Engine generates the course in the Learning Environment.
