# Interactions

Interaction Diagrams are used to depict the dynamics of a system over time: how users and components interact. Our Interaction Diagrams include an overview as well as further diagrams showing dynamics of Course Creation and the Learning Analytics Platform. 


## Interactions Diagram 1 based on Use Case Scenario "Adaptive LD System"

This is a visual representation of the actors within our automated course generator system and the objects that they interact with. The Learning Environment is generated by the Course Designer via the Personalisation Engine. The Personalisation Engine is where the Course Designer sets boundaries regarding what data is to be pulled from the Course Cloud Repository and the Web Engine. The Learner interacts with the Learning Environment which is monitored by the Instructor and by xAPI. xAPI stores user data and sends this data to the Learning Analytics Platform for processing and then to the Personalisation Engine for viewing by the Course Designer. The Course Designer then activates a process pulling additional resources from the Web engine and the Course Cloud Depository in order to recommend additional resources to the Learner based on any areas needing improvement. A System Designer provides technical support to the Learning Environment.

## Interactions Diagram 2 based on Learning Analytics Platform  

This diagram shows the interactions that occur within the Learning Analytics Platform.
The learner interacts with the Learning Environment producing a set of actions which are fed to the xAPI. 
The xAPI tracks those actions and stores the learner's data into the Learning Analytics Platform.
The Learning Analytics Platform then feeds this data into the Personalisation Engine and the Cloud Repository so they can later on make adjustments to the course based on this data.
The instructor accesses the data from the Learning Analytics Platform to monitor learners' perfomance in the course and be aware of their actions.

## Interactions Diagram 3 based on Use Case Scenario "Adaptive LD with Design Critique Integrated"

This sequence diagram model show actors add resources and activities into a Cloud Repository on an ongoing basis. When a course needs to be designed the Course Designer enters in course details such as subjects, pedagogy and course duration into the Personalisation Engine. The Personalisation Engine then searches through both the Cloud Repository and the Web to find suitable resources and activities to meet the criteria as entered by the Course Designer into the Personalisation Engine. The Course Designer then reviews and approves what the engine retreives. Once approved, the course is set up as a prototype. At this point the Community of Practice, Teachers, Students, Designers and Experts have the opportunity to conduct a design critique. Once adjustments / improvements are made to the design, the Course Designer gives a final approval and the Personalisation Engine generates the course in the Learning Environment.
