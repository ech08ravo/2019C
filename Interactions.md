# Interaction (sequence, activity) diagrams

Keep your interaction sequences in this document, or create further documents of this kind if documents gets too long. Note that when you render the markdown in html you can get an url for any heading by pointing to the left of the heading and then right-click and copy the heading bookmark link.

## Sequence diagram  1

This is a visual representation of the actors within our automated course generator system and the objects they interact with. A System Designer deposits any additional data into a course cloud depositor. A learning environment is generated by a Course Designer who sets boundaries regarding what data is to be pulled from the depositry. The learner interacts with this learning environment which is monitored by CoachU. CoachU recommends additional resources to the learner based on any areas needing improvement.

## Sequence diagram 2
This sequence diagram models how actors add resources and activities into a Cloud Depository on an ongoing basis.  Then, when a course needs to be designed, the course designer enters in the course details (such as subjects, time frame, etc.) into a Personalisation Engine. The Personalisation Engine then searches through both the Cloud Depository and the Web to find suitable resources and activities to meet the course details as entered by the Course Designer into the Personalisation Engine.  The Course Designer then reviews and approves what the engine retreived.  Once approved, the course is set up as a prototype.  The Community of Practice and the Teachers, Designers and Expert conduct a design critique.  Once adjustments / improvements are made in for the design, then the Course Designer gives a final approval and the Personalisation Engine sets up the course in the Learning Environment.
